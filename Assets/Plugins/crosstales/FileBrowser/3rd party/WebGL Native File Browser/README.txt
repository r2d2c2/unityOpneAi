https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/41902?aid=1011lNGT


Please make sure that the "FrostweepGames"-folder is inside "Assets/Plugins". If not, please move it there.



## Important notes
The asset allows to read local files from WebGL. 
The result is the extension and the data (in "CurrentOpenSingleFileData").

Make sure you selected the correct template in the "PlayerSettings".
